     * Remove Extra Edge
     * Problem Description
     *
     * Given a binary tree A where all values of nodes are distinct, there is a pair of leaf nodes which have the same value.
     *
     * Considering that the pair that has the same value is indeed the same node and not two different nodes, return the tree after removing one of the edges from it.
     *
     * You need to remove the edge from the parent whose value is greater.
